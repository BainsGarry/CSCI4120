## Which K works the best? If all Ks have similiar accuracy, please write down your thoughts about "Why."
- K 9-12 works the best for our model. We believe all Ks have similar accuracys because we have a simple data set. In these cases a large range of K values may produce similar results because the closest neighbors are consisently the same independent of the K value.
